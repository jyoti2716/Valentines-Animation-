                Hello My dear hubbby</br></br>

I hope this note finds you with a smile on your face because that's where you belongâ€”in my heart and making me grin like a fool. ðŸ˜Š</br>

I just wanted to drop you a note to remind you how insanely lucky I am to have you in my life. You're like my favorite playlist on repeat .</br> every moment with you feels like the best part of a song that I never want to end.</br>

I'm not great with words, but here goes: I love you more than words can say. You're my anchor in the craziness of life, my partner in crime, and the one who makes my heart do somersaults just by being you.</br>

They say forever is a long time, but with you, it still feels too short. So, here's to our goofy moments, our late-night talks, and the countless adventures still waiting for us.</br> You're not just my boyfriend; you're my love story.</br></br>

Forever yours,</br>
Your sweet heart
            </p>
